## What Is (mem || y) ??

(mem || y) {memory} is a Simon-esque game where the user is presented with a sequence of colors that are displayed. They must then attempt to repeat the sequence correctly.

If successful, the sequence repeats, and continuously builds upon itself at random. This increases the length of the sequence, and the more the user must correctly remember in order to continue to advance in the game.

Once a user has failed to correctly repeat the sequence, they will be taken to a page that displays their results, as well as the "High Scores" of all users who have attempted the game before them.
